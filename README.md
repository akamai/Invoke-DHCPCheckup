# Invoke-DHCPCheckup.ps1

Invoke-DHCPCheckup is a tool meant to identify risky DHCP and DNS configurations in Active Directory environments.
For additional information please refer to our blogpost:
https://akamai.com/blog/security-research/spoofing-dns-by-abusing-dhcp



The tool identifies the following misconfigurations:

### DNS Credential
- DNS Credential is not configured
- The configured DNS credential is of a strong user

### Name Protection
- Name protection is not enabled on a scope
- Name protection is not enabled by default on new scopes

### DNSUpdateProxy
- Display group members 
- Specify whether the members are DHCP servers

### Weak record ACLs
- List records owned by DHCP servers (Managed Records)
- List records that could be overwritten by authenticated users


## Usage
Invoke-DHCPCheckup relies on the DHCP server management API and requires to run as a user that is part of the "DHCP Administrators" and "DNSAdmins" groups.

It also requires the following Powershell modules: 
- ActiveDirectory
- DHCPServer
- DNSServer

To run use the following commands:
```
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Import-Module C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Invoke-DHCPCheckup.ps1
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Invoke-DHCPCheckup -domainName <domain_name> -dnsServerName <adidns_server_fqdn>
```
